This is my personal site and lightweight digital HQ, built to prototype a larger idea:  
**What happens when you start coding yourself out of your own industry?**

---

## üß† What the Project Is

This project is a coded-from-scratch, one-page experience that:

- Introduces me (Lucy Bloomfield) and my background across eCommerce, consulting, and marketing
- Reflects my current work: replacing traditional agency services with automated, productized systems
- Allows people to submit project briefs directly through a conversational chatbot
- Demonstrates a tiny slice of the philosophy behind my upcoming product, **Ten Thousand Customers**

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- Built in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ‚Äî no frameworks, no CMS
- Hosted on GitHub Pages
- Includes:
  - A chatbot-style intro sequence that mimics human conversation
  - A project brief submission form at the end of the sequence
  - A modal with contact links and social profiles (each with contextual descriptions)
  - Real-time clock (set to Adelaide, Australia)
  - Typing indicator animation
  - SEO metadata structured for future product evolution

## üß© What I Learnt

- How to implement vanilla JavaScript animations and interactions from scratch
- How to build a chatbot-style onboarding sequence without relying on third-party libraries
- How to structure and inject clean SEO for single-page sites
- A reminder that shipping *something lightweight and real* beats polishing forever

---

## üöß Where I Got Up To

- Site is live and functional at [lucybloomfield.com.au](https://lucybloomfield.com.au)
- Chatbot flows well and captures project briefs
- Core branding and storytelling are in place
- Design is clean but still feels like an MVP
- The larger product is not yet featured or integrated

---

## üå± What I‚Äôd Love to Add in the Future

- Conditional chatbot branching based on user input
- A ‚ÄúProducts‚Äù section to tease or soft-launch my software
- Email capture integration via Substack or a lead magnet
- A better-designed visual system (typography, layout, animations)
- A proper backend for project submissions (currently using basic form handlers)
- More dynamic content loading and CMS-lite structure (e.g. JSON or markdown-driven)
